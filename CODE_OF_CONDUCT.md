6. **Respect for Intellectual Property**: Honor patents, copyrights, and other forms of IP
7. **Confidentiality**: Protect confidential communications and sensitive data
8. **Responsible Publication**: Publish to advance research and scholarship, not just to advance career
9. **Responsible Mentoring**: Help educate and train the next generation of researchers
